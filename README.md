# Renewable-Energy-Project
Multiple Linear Regression study using US and global renewable energy datasets.  

## Background Introduction
The United States has made great strides to prioritize renewable energy since the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) was enacted in 1978 [1]. As a result, the use of renewable energy in the United States has grown exponentially [2]. Recent technology booms have further emphasized the need for renewable energy as it fosters energy independence and economic growth in addition to contributing towards a more sustainable future.  

## Datasets and Variables
The datasets used are: 
- [U.S. Renewable Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/renewable-energy-consumption-in-the-u-s)

- Nuclear Electric Power Production: The total electricity generated from nuclear power. 
- Total Renewable Energy Production: The total amount of energy produced from renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, etc.). 
- Total Primary Energy Production: The total amount of primary energy produced from all sources. 
- Primary Energy Imports: The amount of primary energy imported from other countries. 
- Primary Energy Exports: The amount of primary energy exported to other countries. 
- Primary Energy Net Imports: The net amount of primary energy imported (imports minus exports). 
- Primary Energy Stock Change and Other: Changes in energy stock levels and other related data. 
- Total Fossil Fuels Consumption: The total amount of fossil fuels consumed. 
- Nuclear Electric Power Consumption: The total electricity consumed from nuclear power. 
- Total Renewable Energy Consumption: The total amount of energy consumed from renewable sources. 
- Total Primary Energy Consumption: The total amount of primary energy consumed from all sources.

## Research Questions
1. [The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) included legislation intended to promote the use of solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass, and biofuel energy consumption. Can the changes in renewable energy consumption after the implementation of EPAct be explained by the individual contributions of solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass, and biofuel consumption?](https://github.com/awatson246/Renewable-Energy-Project/blob/main/Team_Project_Journals/ProjectJournal_Adriana.ipynb)
2. [In considering 3 different energy production variables (total fossil fuel production, nuclear electric power production, total renewable energy production) and 1 energy import variable (primary energy imports), can at least one of these sources of energy inputs accurately predict total primary energy consumption?](https://github.com/awatson246/Renewable-Energy-Project/blob/main/Team_Project_Journals/ProjectJournal_Erin.ipynb)
3. [Looking at the impact of different renewable sources on the total renewable energy consumption in the U.S. from 1980 to 2021, can the growth in total renewable energy consumption be explained by the combined influence of solar, wind, biomass, and hydroelectric energy?](https://github.com/awatson246/Renewable-Energy-Project/blob/main/Team_Project_Journals/ProjectJournal_Chandler.ipynb)
4. [How does the total renewable energy consumption change based on time (year), seasonal variation (month), and sectoral differences (commercial, electric power, industrial, residential, and transportation) significantly influence trends in the total amount of renewable energy consumed.](https://github.com/awatson246/Renewable-Energy-Project/blob/main/Team_Project_Journals/ProjectJournal_Genna.ipynb)
5. [Does the increase in renewable energy consumption significantly reduce traditional fossil fuel energy consumption in the US and globally? Tests will be done based on US data and global data separately to compare if the tests on the two scales of models would show similar variable impact on target response.](https://github.com/awatson246/Renewable-Energy-Project/blob/main/Team_Project_Journals/ProjectJournal_Shiming.ipynb)
